{-- TODO:
FP 8-9 - Recursive functions
- decide if all logical values in a list are true: and :: [Bool] -> Bool
- concatenate a list of lists: concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
- produce a list with n identical elements: replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
- select the nth element of a list: (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
- decide if a value is an element of a list: elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
- Merge 2 sorted lists of values to give a single sorted list: merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
- quicksort using recursion

- how foldr howks?
